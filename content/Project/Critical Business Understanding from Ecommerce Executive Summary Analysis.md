### 📈 Month over Month Trend line:

**Scenario:** Throughout the year monthly percentage growth was always around the average of 1% growth. This follows the same pattern with minimal dip in the month of January, August and November up until 2024. However, in 2025 there is a sharp decline of -62% in September, an average around USD 100,000 loss in comparison to September 2024 and 2023. Start of holidays can be one of the reasons, additionally decreasing marketing budget could be the reason of losing customers.

**Solution:** Increasing marketing budget and targeting high price category customer in high conversion rate channels could be a moderate solution to tackle this decline. 

### 💹 Year over Year Comparison:

**Scenario:** -30.93% negative revenue explains that the business still need to achieve 30.93% worth of revenue to match the sales amount of 2024 in Q4 of 2025. 

**Solution:** Creating a massive 11.11 and 12.12 sales campaign can match the sales amount of 2024. This will help the business to keep a healthy total profit margin to recuperate for any further loss.

### 🗺️ Regional Performance:

**Scenario:** A clear well-balanced sales in all the regions in terms of revenue. The business is doing to good to attract customers in all regions simultaneously. 

### 📻 Top 3 Product:

**Scenario:** Electronics is accounted for 56.59% of the total revenue to date. But can it be increased? Most expensive pricing items holds the answer for this. Even though the electronics has the highest amount of order, most of the orders came from low price segments. We have only **9 sales pricing > 2000$**, a shocking revelation. 

**Solution:** Increasing marketing budget and create a lucrative sales campaign for higher pricing segments to catch the upcoming holiday expenses will improve the sales on the higher pricing segments.

### Conclusion: 
Two Decision to make to maintain the business profit margin:
- Launching a sales campaign of the year with more marketing budget to tackle the September 2025 negative revenue trends. 
- Providing combo offer for existing stock of beauty product because of the **lowest cost to revenue ratio** of only **0.6** and **18%** of the total order amount, **the highest**.
